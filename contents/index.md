What is Nodeschool
------------------
(NodeSchool.io)[http://www.nodeschool.io] is a open source community that helps interested beginners get started with Node.js.

NodeSchool has installable choose-your-own-adventure style lessons to learn how to use Node.js, npm and other related tools by writing code to solve realistic problems.  You can head over to http://nodeschool.io/ and check out the courses.

The lessons run in your terminal and work on Windows, Mac and Linux.

As a student you are required to bring your own laptop (Mac, Linux, or Windows).  Instructions with how and what to install will follow.  Food, drinks, and wifi will be provided.  Mentors will be on hand to help you get setup, ask questions, and assist you in your Node.js adventure.
